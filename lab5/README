See Main.hs for example usage.
Note that you will need to install yices-1.0.40. Not the newest version!

MG: I had to make some changes to get the code running. Also it is
    not immediately clear how much of the basic yices sample code
    is still here and the whole Main.hs could use some cleanup.
