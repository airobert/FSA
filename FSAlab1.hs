-- foldr can work on infinite list but not foldl. 
-- Since foldr will immediately return the application of f to the recursive case 
-- of folding over the rest of the list, if f is able to produce some part 
-- of its result without reference to the recursive case, and the rest of the 
-- result is never demanded, then the recursion will stop. This allows right folds 
-- to operate on infinite lists.

-- foldl is more effecient since it use tail recursion since foldl will immediately
-- call itself with new parameters until it reaches the end of the list. Compiled as 
-- a loop, this tail recursion can be efficiently, but can't deal with infinite 
-- lists at all it will recurse forever in an infinite loop.
